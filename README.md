# Godot 4 Infinite Save System

An infinite save system for Godot 4. You can create new saves, overwrite saves,
load saves, and delete / mass delete saves. Actual save serialization /
deserialization is not included since that's game-specific.

Here is the version for Godot 3: https://github.com/ShatReal/infinite-save-system
